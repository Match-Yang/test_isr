# Capture screenshots

---

## Feature Description

Cloud Recording supports two types of screenshot features: [Automatic Screenshots without Recording](#automatic-screenshots-without-recording) and [Manual Screenshots with Recording](#manual-screenshots-with-recording).

This document describes how to take video screenshots using the cloud recording APIs.

## Automatic Screenshots without Recording

Automatic Screenshots without Recording refers to taking screenshots of video streams at fixed intervals in both **Single-Stream Recording mode** and **Mixed-Stream Recording mode**. Screenshots are saved in JPG format.

<Warning title="Warning">
- In Single-Stream Recording mode, screenshot operations will be charged at Single-Stream Recording rates based on the screenshot resolution.
- In Mixed-Stream Recording mode, screenshot operations will only be charged at Single-Stream Recording rates based on the screenshot resolution, without additional recording fees.
</Warning>

To capture screenshots, set the `OutputFileFormat` to "jpg" when calling the [StartRecord](/cloud-recording-server/start) method. You can control the screenshot interval by setting the `SnapshotInterval` parameter. The service takes a screenshot of all streams every 10 seconds by default.

<Warning title="Warning">
* Taking screenshots is not **available** when the `StreamType` is 1 (only audio). Video streams are required for screenshots.
* When querying screenshot task status through the [DescribeRecordStatus](/cloud-recording-server/describe-record-status), the response parameters will not include the file list.
</Warning>

The captured screenshots during recording will be uploaded to your third-party cloud storage, and you will receive a notification through a callback every time a screenshot task is completed, with each callback corresponding to one screenshot file.

### Sample request

Below is an example of starting automatic screenshots in Single-Stream Recording mode.

`Content-type`: `application/json;charset=utf-8` 

The request body of `StartRecord` is as follows:

```json
{
    "RoomId": "xxxx",
    "RecordInputParams": {
        "RecordMode": 1,
        "StreamType": 3,
        "MaxIdleTime": 60
    },
    "RecordOutputParams": {
        "OutputFileFormat": "jpg",
        "OutputFolder": "record/",
        "SnapshotInterval": 10
    },
    "StorageParams": {
        "Vendor": 2,
        "Region": "oss-xxxx",
        "Bucket": "xxxx",
        "AccessKeyId": "xxxx",
        "AccessKeySecret": "xxxx"
    }
}
```

## Manual Screenshots with Recording

Manual Screenshots with Recording refers to taking screenshots by calling the server API [TakeSnapshot](/cloud-recording-server/take-snapshot) when needed after starting a **Mixed-Stream Recording** task.

<Note title="Note">
When taking manual screenshots during Mixed-Stream Recording, you will only be charged at Single-Stream Recording rates based on the screenshot resolution, without additional recording fees.
