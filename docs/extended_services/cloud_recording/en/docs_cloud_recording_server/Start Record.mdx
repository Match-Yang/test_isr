# Start recording

---

## Description

You can call this method to start a cloud recording task.

After you successfully call the `StartRecord` method, the Cloud Recording will record the audio and video streams and whiteboards in the room based on the specified recording parameters. 

<Warning title="Warning">
- Each recording task may last up to 24 hours. When the recording duration reaches the maximum, the recording task automatically ends.
- ZEGOCLOUD recommends that each of your recording tasks call the [Stop recording](./Stop%20Recording.mdx) method to stop recording to avoid additional costs for continued recording.
</Warning>

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| :-------- | :--- | :------- | :---------- |
| RoomId | String | Yes | Room ID. |
| RecordInputParams | Object | Yes | Recording task input parameters.<br />For details, see <a href="#recordinputparams">RecordInputParams member parameters</a>. |
| RecordOutputParams | Object | No | Recording task output parameters.<br />For details, see <a href="#recordoutputparams">RecordOutputParams member parameters</a>. |

### RecordInputParams

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| :-------- | :--- | :------- | :---------- |
| RecordMode | Int | Yes | Recording mode.<ul><li>1: single-stream recording</li><li> 2: mixed-stream recording</li></ul> |
| StreamType | Int | No | Recording type of a media stream. This parameter is valid only for audio or video streams. For whiteboards, only video files will be recorded.<ul><li>1: only audio files</li><li>2: only video files</li><li>3 (default value): combined audio and video files</li><li>4: separate audio and video files</li></ul> |
| RecordStreamList | Array of Object | No | List of streams to be recorded. This parameter is valid only in single-stream recording mode.<br />For details, see <a href="#recordstreamlist">RecordStreamList member parameters</a>.<br />If the parameter is not specified or set to an empty list, all streams in the room will be recorded by default. |
| <p id="FillBlank">FillBlank</p> | Bool | No | <p>Whether to automatically fill in the gap when the stream is interrupted, the default value is false, which means no filling.</p><ul><li>true: When the user's streaming is interrupted, it will be automatically filled in. The effect of automatic filling depends on the recording mode.<ul><li><strong>Single-stream recording</strong>: It only works for audio streaming.<Note title="Note"><p>If the streaming end only publishs a video stream, or the recording media type is only recording video, automatic filling will not be possible.</p></Note>During the interruption, the ZEGOCLOUD server will add silent frames to the audio until the same stream ID is used to publish the stream in the room again. In the end, the same recording file will retain the normal streaming content and silent frames.</li><li><strong>Mixed-stream recording</strong>: During the interruption, the video will pause at the last frame (by default) or display the background image of the stream. In addition, if there is no audio content in the mix-stream, the server will add silent frames until the same stream ID is used to push the stream in the room again. In the end, the same recording file will retain the normal streaming content, filled-in frames, and silent frames (if any).If you need to use the stream's background image as the filling, please refer to the parameter descriptions of <a href="#DefaultMixStreamBackgroundImage">DefaultMixStreamBackgroundImage</a> and <a href="#BackgroundImage">BackgroundImage</a>. The setting of the stream's background image will only take effect when performing mix-stream recording (i.e., when the value of RecordMode is 2).</li></ul></li><li>false (default value): no. When the user resumes the streaming, a new recording file is generated.</li></ul><p>There are two possible timing for the filling during interruption:</p><ul><li>Automatic stop of cloud recording due to the timeout of the room without a stream, see the definition of MaxIdleTime.</li><li>Manually stop the cloud recording.</li></ul> |
| FillFrame | Object | No | Settings for filling in screens after the camera is turned off while the audio streaming continues. This parameter is valid only in mixed-stream recording mode.<br />For details, see <a href="#fillframe">FillFrame member parameters</a>. |
| RecordMuteAudio | Int | No | Whether to record audio frames in mute mode. This parameter is valid only in the following scenarios: a single stream is recorded; only audio files are recorded and they are stored in MP3 format.<ul><li>1 (default value): yes</li><li>2: no</li></ul> |
| RecordMuteAudioSplitThreshold | Int | No | Mute time threshold for automatically split recording files, in seconds.<br />When the mute duration of a stream reaches this threshold during the recording, a new recording file will be generated.<br />This parameter is valid only in the following scenarios: a single stream is recorded; only audio files are recorded; the recording file is stored in MP3 mode and `RecordMuteAudio` is set to `2`.<br />If this parameter is set to 0, a separate recording file is generated immediately when a stream is muted. If this parameter is set to 0 or a negative value, the recording file will not be split. |
| HasWhiteboard | Bool | No | Whether to record a whiteboard.<ul><li>true: yes </li><li>false (default value): no</li></ul>If this parameter is set to `true`, the `Whiteboard` parameter is required. |

| <p id="MaxIdleTime">MaxIdleTime</p> | Int | No | Maximum duration with no stream or whiteboard after which cloud recording automatically stops, in seconds. The default value is `30`. The value must be greater or equal to 5, and less than or equal to 86400 (24 hours).<br /><b>Note: This parameter is valid only when there is no stream or whiteboard in the room.</b><br/> |
| <p id="MaxRecordTime">MaxRecordTime</p> | Int | No | Maximum duration of a recording task. Recording automatically stops when the duration reaches the maximum, in seconds. The default value is `86400`. The value must be greater or equal to 300 and less than or equal to 86400 (24 hours). |
| MixConfig | Object | No | Mixed-stream settings. This parameter is required when `RecordMode` is set to `2`.<br />For details, see <a href="#mixconfig">MixConfig member parameters</a>. |

<Warning title="Warning">
- `FillBlank` and `MaxIdleTime` have different application scopes.
  - `FillBlank`: applies to the stream. Assume that `FillBlank` is set to `true`. When the streaming is interrupted, the system supplements blank screens as long as the recording task is still ongoing. In this case, the interrupted streaming status will not affect the judgment of whether there is a stream in the room.
  - `MaxIdleTime`: applies to the recording task. When the duration with no stream in a room exceeds the maximum specified by `MaxIdleTime`, the recording task ends.
- In mixed-stream recording mode, when `StreamType` is `1`, only audio files are recorded and the whiteboards are not.
