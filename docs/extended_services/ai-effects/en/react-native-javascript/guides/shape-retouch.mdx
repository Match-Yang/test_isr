# Face shape retouch

- - -

The ZegoEffects SDK provides various face shape retouch features, including face slimming, eyes enlarging, mouth shape adjustment, teeth whitening, and more. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin to use the SDK's face shape retouch features in your project, make sure you complete the following steps:

- You have integrated the ZegoEffects SDK and implemented basic image processing functionality. For details, see [Implement basic image processing](./../quick-starts/implement-basic-image-processing.mdx).
- You have imported the basic "CommonResources" resource files. For details, see [Import resources and models](./../quick-starts/import-resources-and-models.mdx).

## Implementation steps

In general, take the following steps to implement a face shape retouch feature:

1. Enable the feature.
2. Specify the parameters of the face shape retouch feature as needed. If not specified, the SDK uses the default settings.

### Eyes Enlarging

<Warning title="Warning">

Before using the eyes enlarging feature, please import the corresponding "FaceDetectionModel" model files, otherwise the feature will not take effect. For details, please refer to [Import resources and models](./../quick-starts/import-resources-and-models.mdx).

Call the [enableBigEyes](@enableBigEyes) interface to enable the eyes enlarging feature, and call the [setBigEyesParam](@setBigEyesParam) interface to set the degree of eyes enlarging.  

The "intensity" parameter of the [ZegoEffectsBigEyesParam](@-ZegoEffectsBigEyesParam) object, which represents the degree of eyes enlarging, has a value range of [0, 100], with a default value of "50". The higher the value, the greater the degree of eyes enlarging. Developers can customize the value according to their needs.

```js
// Enable eyes enlarging feature
mEffects.enableBigEyes(true);

// Set the degree of eyes enlarging, range [0, 100], default is 50

mEffects.setBigEyesParam({ intensity: 100 });
```
