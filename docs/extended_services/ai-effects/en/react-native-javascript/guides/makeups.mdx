# Beauty makeups

- - -

The ZegoEffects SDK provides the beauty makeup feature, which can put virtual makeups on your facial features, such as eyeliner, eyelashes, blusher, lipstick, and colored eye contacts, and also provides various makeup looks.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin to use the beauty makeup feature, make sure:

- You have integrated the ZegoEffects SDK and implemented basic image processing functionality. For details, see [Implement basic image processing](./../quick-starts/implement-basic-image-processing.mdx).
- You have imported the basic "MakeupResources" resource files. For details, see [Import resources and models](./../../ios-objc/quick-starts/import-resources-and-models.mdx).

## Implementation steps 

The beauty markups include these features: eyeliner, eyeshadow, eyelashes, blusher, lipstick, colored eye contacts, and makeup looks.

Each feature provides various styles:

- [Eyeliner](#eyeliner): Natural, Cat Eye, naughty, innocent,dignified.
- [Eyeshadow](#eyeshadow): Pink Mist, Shimmer Pink, Tea Brown, Bright Orange, Mocha_Brown.
- [Eyelashes](#eyelashes): Natural, Tender, Curl, Everlong, Thick.
- [Blusher](#blusher): Slightly Drunk, Peach, Milky Orange, Apricot Pink, Sweet Orange.
- [Lipstick](#lipstick): Cameo Pink, Sweet Orange, Rust Red, Coral, Red Velvet.
- [Colored eye contacts](#colored-eye-contacts): Darknight Black, Starry Blue, Mystery Brown-Green, Polar Lights Brown, Chocolate Brown.
- [Makeup looks](#makeup-looks): Vulnerable & Innocent Eyes, Milky Eyes, Cutie & Cool, Pure & Sexy, Flawless.


<Warning title="Warning">

- **You can't superimpose the styles of each feature. Once you apply a new style, the previous one (if any) will be overridden.**
- **You can superimpose the effects of eyeliner, eyeshadow, eyelashes, blusher, lipstick, and colored eye contacts, but you can't superimpose those with the makeup looks.**
</Warning>

Specify the parameters of the beauty makeup feature as needed. If not specified, the SDK uses the default settings.

### Eyeliner

1. Enable Eyeliner.

    Call the [setEyeliner](@setEyeliner) interface to enable/disable the eyeliner feature, passing in the absolute path of the corresponding eyeliner. Call the [setEyelinerParam](@setEyelinerParam) interface to set the intensity of the eyeliner.

    The "intensity" parameter of the [ZegoEffectsEyelinerParam](@-ZegoEffectsEyelinerParam) object, which represents the intensity of the eyeliner, has a value range of [0, 100]. The higher the value, the greater the degree of effect presentation. Developers can customize the value according to their needs.

    ```java
    // Enable eyeliner feature
    // 1. Enable eyeliner feature, and pass in the absolute path of the corresponding eyeliner
    mEffects.setEyeliner("/xxx/xxx/eyelinerdir/eyelinerdir_natural.bundle");

    // Set eyeliner intensity, range [0, 100]
    mEffects.setEyelinerParam({ intensity: 100 });
    ```
   
2. Remove Eyeliner.

    If you need to remove the eyeliner, pass `null` into the [setEyeliner](@setEyeliner) interface.
