# Implement basic image processing

---

This document describes how to implement basic image processing with the ZegoEffects SDK. 

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the basic image processing functionality, make sure you complete the following steps:


- Integrate the ZegoEffects SDK into your project. For more information, see [Quick starts - Integration](./import-the-sdk.mdx).
- Get the unique license file of the SDK. For details, see [Online authentication](./online-authentication.mdx).
- A project has been created in [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) and applied for a valid AppID and AppSign. For details, please refer to [Console - How to view project information](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/16144) .


## Implementation steps

The following diagram shows the  API call sequence of basic image processing with the ZegoEffects SDK:

## Create a ZegoEffects object

1. Import the AI resources and models.
   
     To use the SDK's AI features, you must import the necessary AI resources or models by calling the `setResources` method. For details, see [Quick starts - Import resources and models](./import-resources-and-models.mdx).

    ```objc
    // Specify the absolute path of the face recognition model, which is required for various features including Face detection, eyes enlarging, and face slimming.
    NSString *faceDetectionModelPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"FaceDetectionModel" ofType:@"model"];

    // Specify the absolute path of the portrait segmentation model, which is required for AI portrait segmentation.
    NSString *segmentationModelPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"SegmentationModel" ofType:@"model"];

    NSArray<NSString *> * modelList = @[faceDetectionModelPath, segmentationModelPath];

    // Set the list of model paths, which must be called before calling the create method.
    [ZegoEffects setResources:resourcesList];
    ```
     
2. Deploy Advanced Configuration

    Call the [setAdvancedConfig](@setAdvancedConfig) interface to deploy advanced configuration items, such as configuring device performance levels. For details, please refer to [Configure Device Performance Level](./configure-device-performance-levels.mdx).

    ```objc
    // Set advancedConfig
    ZegoEffectsAdvancedConfig *config = [ZegoEffectsAdvancedConfig alloc];
    // Configure device performance level
    [ZegoEffects setAdvancedConfig:config];
    ```

3. Create Effects Object

    Pass the AppID and AppSign obtained from the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) directly to the [create](https://doc-zh.zego.im/article/api?doc=Effects_SDK_API~objectivec_ios~class~ZegoEffects#create-appid-app-sign-2) interface. After internal authentication by the SDK, it will create an Effects object and return the corresponding [error code](!Error_Codes/Error_Codes).

    ```objc
    NSInteger appId = *******;
    NSString *appSign = @"********";
    self.effects = [ZegoEffects create:appid appSign:appSign];
    ``` 

## Initialize the ZegoEffects object

1. Call the `initEnv` method to initialize the `ZegoEffects` object, passing in the width and height of the original image to be processed.

    ```objc
    // Initialize the ZegoEffects object, passing in the width and height of the original image to be processed.
    [self.effects initEnv:CGSizeMake(1280, 720)];
    ```

2. Call the following methods to enable the AI features you want to use.

    - `enableWhiten`
    - `enableBigEyes`
    - `setPortraitSegmentationBackgroundPath`
    - `enablePortraitSegmentation` 
    
    ```objc
    // 1. Enable the skin tone enhancement feature.
    [self.effects enableWhiten:YES];
    
    // 2. Enable the eyes enlargeing feature.
    [self.effects enableBigEyes:YES];
    
    // 3. Enable the AI portrait segmentation feature, passing in the absolute path of the segmented background image.
    [self.effects setPortraitSegmentationBackgroundPath: @"MY_BACKGROUND_PATH" mode:ZegoEffectsScaleModeAspectFill];
    [self.effects enablePortraitSegmentation:YES];
    ```



## Perform image processing

Call the `processImageBuffer` method to perform image processing, passing in the original video image to be processed, and the processed result will be written back to the original buffer.

```objc
// Pass in the original video image to be processed, and the processed result will be written back to the original buffer.
[self.effects processImageBuffer:pixelBuffer];
```
