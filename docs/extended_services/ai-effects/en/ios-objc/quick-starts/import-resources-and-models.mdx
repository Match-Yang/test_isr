# Import resources and models

---

## Introduction

This document will introduce how to import the AI resources and models provided by ZegoEffects SDK.

## Implementation Steps

1. Before using the AI features provided by ZegoEffects SDK, please download the latest version of AI resources and models (files with the suffix bundle or model) from the [downloads](./../downloads.mdx) page of the SDK, and copy them to your project for later use.
    <Note title="Note">

    If you need to use functions such as Face beautification, Face shape retouch, Skin tone enhancement, Teeth whitening, Cheek blusher, Stickers, Eyes enlarging, Face sliming, and Portrait segmentation, please import the corresponding resources and models from the SDK package first.
    </Note>
2. Specify the absolute path of the AI resources and models. **Please download the latest version of AI resources and models (files with the suffix bundle or model) from the [downloads](./../downloads.mdx) page.**

    ```objc
   // Pass in the absolute paths of the models and resources. Resources and models for Face beautification, Face shape retouch, Skin tone enhancement, Teeth whitening, Cheek blusher, Stickers, Eyes enlarging, Face sliming, and Portrait segmentation need to be imported.
    NSString *commonResources = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"CommonResources" ofType:@"bundle"];
    NSString *faceWhiteningResources = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"FaceWhiteningResources" ofType:@"bundle"];
    // Only versions before 2.0.0 support Stickers feature
    NSString *pendantResources = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"PendantResources" ofType:@"bundle"];
    NSString *teethWhiteningResources = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"TeethWhiteningResources" ofType:@"bundle"];
    NSString *rosyResources = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"RosyResources" ofType:@"bundle"];
    // Only supported in version 2.0.0 or later, resources for clarity function
    NSString *clarityResources = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"ClarityResources" ofType:@"bundle"];

    // Pass in the absolute path of the face detection model. Face detection, Eyes enlarging, and Face sliming functions require importing this model.
    NSString *faceDetectionModelPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"FaceDetectionModel" ofType:@"model"];

    // Pass in the absolute path of the portrait segmentation model. Portrait segmentation function requires importing this model.
    NSString *segmentationModelPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"SegmentationModel" ofType:@"model"];

    NSArray<NSString *> * resourcesList = @[commonResources, faceWhiteningResources, pendantResources, teethWhiteningResources, rosyResources,faceDetectionModelPath,segmentationModelPath];

    // Adjust skin color resources (Only supported in version 2.0.0 or later. Options: meihei, maise, lengbai, nuanbai, fenbai)
    // Example: meihei (dark skin)
    NSString *skinColorFolderPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"SkinColorResources" ofType:nil];
    NSString *skinColorBundlePath = [skinColorFolderPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@.bundle", @"meihei"]];
    ```

3. Before calling the [create](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/api?doc=Effects_SDK_API~objectivec_ios~class~ZegoEffects#create-appid-app-sign-callback-1) interface to create an object, call the [setResources](@setResources) interface to pass in the model and resource path list to load the models and resources.

    ```objc
    // Pass in the model and resource path list, must be called before create
    [ZegoEffects setResources:resourcesList];
    ```

## Supported Models and Resources
