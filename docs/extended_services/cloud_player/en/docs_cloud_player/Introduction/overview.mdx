# Overview

- - -

ZEGOCLOUD Cloud Player is an extension capability developed by ZEGOCLOUD for real-time audio and video communication, interactive live streaming, and other scenarios. Developers can integrate and call the Cloud Player through simple APIs to create a cloud player, pull "media files" through URLs and convert them into "real-time streams", and push them to the specified RTC room for users to watch.

The streams pushed to the room in this way are also applicable to other audio and video-related services, such as user pulling streams in the room, mixing streams, cloud recording, audio and video content moderation, etc.

In practice, if you require a more stable and reliable playback experience, you can use the ZEGOCLOUD file upload solution to upload the files to the same region of ZEGOCLOUD Audio & Video Cloud. The cloud player service can then fetch the required resources via the internal network, improving playback stability.

File upload is a value-added service for the cloud player. For detailed pricing and usage information, please contact ZEGOCLOUD's sales team.

## Application scenarios

|Scenario   | Description|
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Unmanned radio | In scenarios such as FM radio and voice chat rooms, developers can use the cloud player capability to play background music or audio files in a loop in the same room, achieving an unmanned radio station. |
| Pseudo-live streaming | In scenarios such as "online education", teachers can pre-record course files containing course knowledge points, feedback, and answers before class. During the class, students can directly watch the pre-recorded courses by the teacher and engage in interactive learning through voice, video, and other means. |
| Watch together | For on-demand entertainment content such as movies and music, the cloud player can convert media files into real-time streams and push them to the same live room, allowing the host and audience to watch movies, listen to music, and have real-time interactive discussions together. |

## Features
| Main function | Function description |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Importing online media streams | Developers can use server-side APIs to create and maintain cloud-based players that can convert online media streams into real-time streams and push them to specified RTC rooms. Users in the rooms can directly pull the streams to watch. |
| Support for multiple streaming formats and protocols | <ul><li>Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS.</li><li>Container formats: MP3, MP4, FLV, WAV, M3U8, AAC, FLAC.</li><li>Video encoding formats: H.264, VP8, H.265.</li><li>Audio encoding formats: AAC, OPUS.</li></ul> |
| Playback control | <ul><li>Support for controlling the number of times the media is played, enabling looped playback.</li><li>Support for controlling the playback state, such as start, pause, and stop.</li><li>Support for setting and updating the playback progress.</li></ul> |
| Transcoding | Support for transcoding the streams pushed to the rooms, with the following audio and video parameters configurable:<ul><li>AudioOptions: Set audio transcoding format, sample rate, bitrate, number of channels, volume, etc.</li><li>VideoOptions: Set video transcoding format, resolution, frame rate, bitrate, video padding mode, etc.</li></ul> |

## Product advantages

#### Easy integration with low entry barrier

By simply calling the server-side APIs, developers can quickly integrate and implement the solution without the need for server deployment and maintenance. This significantly reduces development costs and helps accelerate product launch.

#### Rich in features, meeting various scenario requirements

Providing comprehensive cloud player services, supporting multiple media file container formats, audio and video encoding formats, precise control of playback progress and loop times, setting transcoding parameters before streaming, and other capabilities. Different capabilities can be freely combined to meet various scenario requirements such as voice chat rooms, online education, and watching live broadcasts together.

#### Flexible combination with RTC capability

The cloud player supports the quick integration of RTC and live streaming with complementary cloud services, such as user pulling and streaming in a room, mixing streams, etc. These capabilities can be seamlessly applied to various audio and video business scenarios, expanding the boundaries of business.
