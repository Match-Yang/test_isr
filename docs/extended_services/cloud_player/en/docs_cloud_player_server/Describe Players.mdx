| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| RoomId | String | No | Specify the room ID to query, with a length of up to 128 bytes.<strong>If RoomId is filled in, please make sure that the RoomId already exists, otherwise the query result may be empty.</strong> |
| PlayerId | String | No | Unique identifier ID of the cloud player, returned by [CreatePlayer](./Create%20Player.mdx).<strong>If PlayerId is filled in, please make sure that the PlayerId already exists, otherwise the query result may be empty.</strong> |
| PageSize | Number | No | Pagination size, with a value range of (0, 50]. The default is 50 tasks per page, which indicates the maximum number of task lists returned by calling this interface at a time. <strong>To obtain task lists beyond the PageSize value, you need to use the NextPageToken (query task list pagination starting position) value returned in the previous call to this interface to call this interface again for query.</strong>For example, if there are currently 123 cloud player tasks and PageSize is set to 50, when calling this interface for query:<ol><li>For the first call to this interface, the input parameter PageToken is empty, and the player tasks from 1 to 50 are queried. The returned NextPageToken value is assumed to be "pagetoken1".</li><li>For the second call to this interface, the input parameter PageToken is set to "pagetoken1", and the player tasks from 51 to 100 are queried. The returned NextPageToken value is assumed to be "pagetoken2".</li><li>For the third call to this interface, the input parameter PageToken is set to "pagetoken2", and the player tasks from 101 to 123 are queried. The query is completed, and the returned NextPageToken is empty.</li></ol> |
| PageToken | String | No | Query task list pagination starting position. <strong>If this parameter is not filled in, the first page task list found will be returned by default.</strong>Each time this interface is called, the NextPageToken will be returned in the response result. Developers need to determine whether the last page has been queried. |
