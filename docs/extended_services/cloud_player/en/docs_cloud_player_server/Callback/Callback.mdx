# Callback
- - -

## Overview

<Warning title="Warning">
Callback services cannot guarantee complete reliability. Please carefully consider the risks of using callback solutions to build core business processes.
</Warning>

During the operation of the cloud player, it will send an HTTP request to the `callback address` in the form of POST, and the request body is in JSON format. With this request, you can listen to events related to player tasks and upload tasks.

<Warning title="Warning">

Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to configure the callback address.
</Warning>

## Callback parameters

<Note title="Note">

ZEGOCLOUD will continuously optimize and update the callback parameters in future iterations (such as adding fields or adding parameter values for certain fields). When developers integrate, please avoid hard-coding the code, which may cause incompatibility with new versions after later updates.
</Note>

After detecting the above abnormal events, the cloud player will automatically retry. If you receive multiple notifications of this type of exception callback in a short period of time, developers need to check if the resource server access is normal or take other fault-tolerant measures.


## Callback example

<Tabs>
<Tab title="For Player Creation">
Here is an example of a successful callback after calling the [CreatePlayer](./../Create%20Player.mdx) interface to create a cloud player.

```json
{
  "AppID": 123456789,
  "RoomId": "room_12",
  "PlayerId": "XXXXXX",
  "PlayerName": "XXXXXX",
  "EventType": 1,
  "Nonce": "abcdd22113",
  "Timestamp": "1681221510",
  "Signature": "XXXXXXX",

  }
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="For Upload Task Creation">
Here is an example of a successful callback after calling the [CreateUploadTask](./../Create%20Upload%20task.mdx) interface to create an upload task.

```json
{
  "AppID":"123456789",
  "Detail":{},
  "EventTime":"1737451074593",
  "EventType":10001,
  "Nonce":"947227",
  "Signature":"xxxxx",
  "StreamUrl":"https://your_streamurl","Timestamp":"1737451074",
  "Title":"720.mp4",
  "UploadTaskId":"678f663727b2d80007000001"
}
```

## Response

Returning an HTTP status code of 2XX (e.g. 200) indicates success, while other responses indicate failure.

## Callback retry strategy

If the ZEGOCLOUD server does not receive a response, it will immediately attempt to retry, with a maximum of 2 retries. If the callback still fails after the second retry, it will not be retried again and the callback will be lost.
