<Note title="Note">

Before sharing the screen, a dialog will prompt the user to allow the app to share the screen. 

The user needs to manually grant the permission.
</Note>

The screen sharing feature relies on foreground service to keep the app alive. Therefore, navigate to the "app/src/main" directory, open the "AndroidManifest.xml" file, and add the following permissions:

- If the Android SDK version is **lower than version 34.0.0**, you need to declare the **FOREGROUND_SERVICE** permission.

    ```xml app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
    ```

- If the Android SDK version is **34.0.0 or later**, you need to declare the **FOREGROUND_SERVICE** and **FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION** permission.

    ```xml app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION"/>
    ```
