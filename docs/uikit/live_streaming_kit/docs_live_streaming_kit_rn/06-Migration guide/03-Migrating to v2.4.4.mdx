# Migrating to v2.4.4

In version 2.4.4, we have added `react-native-orientation-locker` to our project to fix the bug that occurs during the switch between landscape and portrait orientations. After upgrading to the 2.4.4 version of Live Streaming Kit or above, you need run the following command to add the new dependency.

<CodeGroup>
```bash title="yarn"
yarn add react-native-orientation-locker@^1.7.0
```
```bash title="npm"
npm install react-native-orientation-locker@^1.7.0
```
</CodeGroup>
