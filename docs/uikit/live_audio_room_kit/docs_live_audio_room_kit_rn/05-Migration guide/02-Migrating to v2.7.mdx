# Migrating to v2.7

In version 2.7, we have added `react-native-device-info` to our project to retrieve device information. After upgrading to the 2.7 version of live audio room kit or above, you need run the following command to add the new dependency, and upgrade the versions of `zegocloud/zego-uikit-rn` and `zego-zim-react-native`.
