To do so, navigate to the "app/src/main" directory, open the "AndroidManifest.xml" file, and add the following permissions:

```xml app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT">
```

<Warning title="Warning">

- If your application needs to be uploaded to the Google Play Store, you may need to make appropriate declarations for these two permissions in order to avoid rejection, due to [Google Play's policies](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13392821?hl=en) restrictions.

- If your device has additional settings for lock screen display, please set them as required to ensure that this feature works properly.
</Warning>
