# Send and receive targeted messages in groups

- - -

## Overview

Targeted messages refer to messages sent in a group that are only visible or invisible to certain members.

The logic for determining whether group members can see targeted messages is as follows:

| User Role | Is message visible to specified user list | Is user in specified user list | Visible |
| ---- | ------------- | --------------- | ---- |
| Sender  | -             | Sender cannot be included in the specified user list. | ✔    |
| Non-sender | ✔             | ✔               | ✔    |
| Non-sender | ✔             | ✘               | ✘    |
| Non-sender | ✘             | ✔               | ✘    |
| Non-sender | ✘             | ✘               | ✔    |


<Note title="Note">
Targeted messages do not count toward unread counts and do not support operations such as reply, reaction, receipt, and edit.
</Note>

## Send targeted messages

When sending a group message through the server interface [Send a group messages](/zim-server/messaging/send-group-messages), you can configure a user list (ReceiverUserIds) by passing in the [TargetOption](/zim-server/messaging/send-group-messages#targetoption) object, and set `Inclusive` to `true` or `false` to specify whether the message is visible to these users.

## Receive targeted messages

After successfully logging in to ZIM SDK, when the user receives a group targeted message that is visible to them, the {getPlatformData(props,groupMessageReceivedMap)} callback is triggered. The <code>isGroupTargetedMessage</code> value in the received {getPlatformData(props,ZIMMessageMap)} is <code>true</code>.

For the example of the {getPlatformData(props,groupMessageReceivedMap)} callback, please refer to [Send and receive messages - Receive messages](./Send%20and%20receive%20messages.mdx#receive-messages).
