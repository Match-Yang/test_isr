# How to determine if an AI agent instance has been created or deleted?

When an agent instance is successfully created and has entered the RTC room and started streaming, the AgentInstanceCreated event will be triggered.

When an agent instance is successfully deleted, the AgentInstanceDeleted event will be triggered. A Code of 0 indicates that the instance was deleted through the server API DeleteAgentInstance.

<Note title="Note">If you attempt to talk to the AI agent before its instance is successfully created, the agent will not respond.</Note>

You can monitor these two events to track the creation and deletion status of agent instances. For more details, please refer to [Get AI Agent Status and Latency Data](./../guides/get-ai-agent-status.mdx#listen-for-agent-related-events).
