# Why can I see AI's subtitles but cannot hear AI's voice?

## 1 Check Configuration and Callback Information

When using the ZEGOCLOUD Real-time Interactive AI Agent service, you may encounter an issue where you can see AI reply subtitles but cannot hear the AI's voice. You can troubleshoot this issue by following these steps:

- Check if the client device's audio playback is working properly by playing other audio content to confirm.

- Troubleshoot whether RTC streaming is normal, ensuring the network connection is stable and not blocked by firewalls.
   > You can monitor the ZEGO Express SDK's onPlayerStateUpdate callback to know whether audio and video streams are successfully pulled.

- Check if the Text-to-Speech (TTS) configuration parameters are correct, including API Key, application ID, and other key information.

- Confirm whether the TTS service account has sufficient balance or has reached the concurrency limit.

- Check if there are any Text-to-Speech (TTS) related errors thrown. Since the AI Agent service passes through the customer's TTS configuration, TTS configuration errors may cause TTS service exceptions, preventing you from hearing the AI's voice. Specific error information can be viewed from the error exception [callbacks](./../callbacks/receiving-callback.mdx).

   <Note title="Note">Confirm that your business service is already listening to exception event callbacks, which is crucial for timely discovery and handling of issues.</Note>

   > View exception event error codes, paying special attention to the following error codes:
   > - 2301: TTS general error
   > - 2302: TTS parameter error
   > - 2303: TTS request authentication failed
   > - 2304: TTS request concurrency limit reached
   > - 2305: TTS account insufficient balance


## 2 Use Analytics Dashboard for Quality Monitoring

You can use the Analytics Dashboard in the ZEGOCLOUD Console to monitor the quality of AI Agent services in real-time:

1. Log in to the ZEGOCLOUD Console.
2. Navigate to the Analytics Dashboard monitoring page (this section can reuse content from other products on how to view streaming quality through the Analytics Dashboard).
3. View relevant service quality metrics, including TTS service response time, error rates, etc.
4. Use the Analytics Dashboard's historical data analysis to pinpoint the specific time and cause of issues.
