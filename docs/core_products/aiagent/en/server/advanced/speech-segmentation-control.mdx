# Speech Segmentation Control

Since LLM (Large Language Model) does not support streaming input, it is necessary to determine whether the user has finished speaking based on real-time ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) results, and then request LLM to start a new round of Q&A.

To determine whether the user has finished speaking, check these parameters:
- `VADSilenceSegmentation`
- `PauseInterval`

## Parameter Description

The two parameters that affect the determination of user's speech completion are in the [ASR parameters](./../api-reference/common-parameter-description.mdx#asr) of registering/updating agents and creating/updating agent instances. The detailed descriptions are as follows:
| Parameter Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VADSilenceSegmentation | Number | No | Sets the duration (in milliseconds) of silence after which two utterances are no longer considered as one. Range: [200, 2000], Default: 500. |
| PauseInterval | Number | No | Sets the duration (in milliseconds) within which two utterances are considered as one, enabling ASR multi-sentence concatenation. Range: [200, 2000]. ASR multi-sentence concatenation is only enabled when this value is greater than VADSilenceSegmentation. |

|Configuration|Q&A Results|
|---|---|
|VADSilenceSegmentation = 500ms,<br/>PauseInterval not set|User is determined to have spoken twice, resulting in 2 turns of Q&A<br/>**round 1:**<br/>- user: The weather is nice today. I want to go out<br/>- assistant: Response 1 (interrupted by round 2)<br/>Context: Empty<br/>**round 2:**<br/>- user: What about you?<br/>- assistant: Response 2<br/>Context: First Q&A round|
|VADSilenceSegmentation = 500ms,<br/>PauseInterval = 1000ms|User is determined to have spoken once, resulting in 1 round of Q&A<br/>- user: The weather is nice today. I want to go out. What about you?<br/>- assistant: Response 1<br/>Context: Empty|

## Best Practice Configurations

<Note title="Note">If you're unsure which configuration works better, we recommend using **Scenario 2** configuration.</Note>

| Scenario | VADSilenceSegmentation | PauseInterval |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scenario 1**: Users speak in short, frequent bursts. E.g., companionship scenarios | 500ms | Not set |
| **Scenario 2**: Users have mixed-length content and are sensitive to latency. E.g., customer service scenarios | 500ms | 1000~1500ms |
| **Scenario 3**: Users typically speak for longer durations and are less sensitive to latency | 1000ms | Not set |
