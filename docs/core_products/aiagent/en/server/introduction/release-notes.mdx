**Improvements & Optimizations**

- During the integration testing period, no separate account application and authentication are required to use services from some ZEGO-supported LLMs (Doubao, MiniMax, Tongyi Qianwen, Stepfun, etc.) and TTS vendors (MiniMax, BytePlus, Alibaba CosyVoice). For details, please refer to [Quick Start](/aiagent-server/quick-start).

### 2025-05-30

<Accordion title="Server v2.2.0" defaultOpen="true">

**New Features**

| Feature | Description | Documentation |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 user vs multiple AI roles | <Note title="Note">Feature is in beta testing, please contact ZEGOCLOUD Business for details.</Note> | - |
|Request body contains agent instance and user information when calling LLM|When creating an agent instance, if the `AddAgentInfo` field is set to `true`, the AI Agent backend will add the `agent_info` field to the request body parameters sent to the custom LLM, which includes `room_id`, `user_id`, and `agent_instance_id` information. This allows for personalized responses based on different users or agent instances, such as calling different function calling or memory based on user IDs. |[Configuring LLM](/aiagent-server/guides/configuring-llm)|
|Callback for each round of user speech audio segment|When creating an agent instance, if the `UserAudioData` field of `CallbackConfig` is set to 1, the AI Agent backend will callback the audio data of the user's speech in the previous 1-1.5 seconds of each round of conversation (if less than 1 second, no callback will be sent). Business side can implement voiceprint recognition and other capabilities based on this audio information. |[Receiving Callback](/aiagent-server/callbacks/receiving-callback)|

**Improvements & Optimizations**

- Optimized the user experience problem caused by subtitle and LLM callback too early when ASR multi-sentence concatenation is enabled. For details, please refer to [Speech Recognition Segmentation](/aiagent-server/advanced/speech-segmentation-control).
