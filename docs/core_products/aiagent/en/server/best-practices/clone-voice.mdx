# Clone Voice for AI Agent

During real-time voice interaction with an AI agent, you can switch the AI agent's voice to a desired voice, such as a user's voice. By recording just a few seconds of the target person's voice, you can instantly replicate their voice timbre, speaking style, accent, and acoustic environment.

Voice cloning is a value-added capability. For pricing details, please contact ZEGOCLOUD business staff.

<Step title="Use cloned voice in voice chats">
When [registering an AI agent](./../api-reference/agent-configuration-management/register-agent.mdx) or [creating an AI agent instance](./../api-reference/agent-instance-management/create-agent-instance.mdx), set the `Params` field in the `TTS` structure. This field will be passed through to the third-party TTS interface, including voice information:

- MiniMax: Fill in `voice_id`
- BytePlus: Fill in `speaker_id`

```json MiniMax {6,7,11}
